<h1>Terms of Service</h1>


<h3>The gist:</h3>
<p>We (the <a href="http://gorepoint.com/">folks at Gorepoint</a>) run a website and service for Twitter users called <a href="index.html">Tweetfave</a> and would love for you to use it. Our basic service is free, and we may offer paid upgrades for advanced features in the future.</p>

<p>If you have questions about these terms, please contact us by email at <span class="hideEmail">info at tweetfave.com</span>.</p>

<h3>Terms of Service:</h3>

<p>The following terms and conditions govern all use of the Tweetfave website and services. The Website is owned and operated by <a href="http://gorepoint.com">Gorepoint</a>. The Website is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, the <a href="privacy.html">Tweetfave Privacy Policy</a>) and procedures that may be published from time to time on this Site by Gorepoint (collectively, the “Agreement”).</p>
<p>Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Website. By accessing or using any part of the web site, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the Website or use any services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by Gorepoint, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms. The Website is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old.</p>

<ol>
<li class="important"><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties.</strong> The Website is provided &#8220;as is&#8221;. Gorepoint and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither Gorepoint nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that the Website will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, the Website at your own discretion and risk.</li>
<li class="important"><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> In no event will Gorepoint, or its suppliers or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of this agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed the fees paid by you to Gorepoint under this agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action. Gorepoint shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</li>
<li><strong>Indemnification.</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Gorepoint, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Payment and Renewal.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>General Terms. </strong><br />
Optional paid services such as extra storage, or domain purchases are available on the Website (any such services, an &#8220;Upgrade&#8221;). By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay Gorepoint the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated. Upgrade fees are not refundable.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Renewal. </strong><br />
Unless you notify Gorepoint before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your Upgrade subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Upgrades can be canceled at any time in the Upgrades section of your site&#8217;s dashboard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Termination. </strong>Gorepoint may terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your Tweetfave account (if you have one), you may cancel your service at any time. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</li>
<li><strong>Changes. </strong>Gorepoint reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to the Website following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes. Gorepoint may also, in the future, offer new services and/or features through the Website (including, the release of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
