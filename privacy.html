<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Tweetfave</a> website and service are developed and operated by <a href="http://gorepoint.com">Gorepoint</a>. It is Gorepoint’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

<p>If you have questions about the privacy policy, or deleting or correcting your personal data, please contact us by email at <span class="hideEmail">info at tweetfave.com</span>.</p>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Gorepoint collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Gorepoint&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Gorepoint&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Gorepoint may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website or service.</p>

<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Visitors who sign up for the Tweetfave service will require Gorepoint to gather personally-identifying information. The sign-up process will collect the visitor's Twitter account information (including their Twitter screen name), their email address, and their IP address. Gorepoint collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the Tweetfave website and service. Gorepoint does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Gorepoint may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Gorepoint may monitor the most popular Twitter feeds and tweets on the Tweetfave site or in individual mails to service subscribers. Gorepoint may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Gorepoint does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Gorepoint discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Gorepoint’s behalf or to provide services available at Gorepoint’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Gorepoint’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Gorepoint will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Gorepoint discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Gorepoint believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Gorepoint, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Tweetfave website and have supplied your email address, Gorepoint may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Tweetfave and our products. Gorepoint takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Gorepoint uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of the Tweetfave website, and their website access preferences. Gorepoint visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Gorepoint’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Gorepoint’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If Gorepoint or the Tweetfave service were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Gorepoint goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Gorepoint may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Gorepoint and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Gorepoint may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Gorepoint’s sole discretion. Gorepoint encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
